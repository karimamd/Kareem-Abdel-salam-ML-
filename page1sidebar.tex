\cvevent{\textbf{Video to Anime Translation  } Graduation Project }{Alexandria University}{Oct 2018-Present}{Alexandria,EG}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing a video translation Deep Learning model that captures location of body parts
\item Using location of chosen key-points on each body part to move an animated character with same motion made in video
\item Making a Unity graphical model that takes array of coordinates of each key-point and moves skeleton of it accordingly
\item Developing a user friendly mobile application that takes user video as input and outputs the motion translation on a chosen animated figure
\item \textit{\textbf{Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, Caffe (C++), Unity, Android (Kotlin)}}
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Sentiment Classification}{Capstone Project: Machine Learning Nanodegree}{October 2018}{Alexandria, EG}
\begin{itemize}
\item Succeeded to implement a well documented Sentiment Classification model on IMDB dataset with good accuracy in comparison to good benchmarks
\item Used Natural Language Processing techniques to prepare data to enter classifiers
\item Extracted features out of text using TF-IDF model
\item Tuned classifiers' hyperparameters using gridSearch to find the best model for the data
\item \textit{\textbf{Supervised Learning,Python , Jupyter Notebooks }}

\cvevent{Autodriving Smartcab (RL) }{Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree}{September 2018}{Alexandria, EG}
\begin{itemize}
\item Successfully implemented Q-Learning to teach a cab to navigate in a simulated environment with 400 different states with high efficiency
\item Crafted a suitable decay function for the exploration rate and optimized values for tolerance and learning rate to make the model generalize in suitable time and with good performance
\item Defined optimal policy and compared learned policy to it
\item \textit{\textbf{Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, Python}}
\end{itemize}
