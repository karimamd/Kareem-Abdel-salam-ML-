\cvevent{\textbf{Video to Anime Translation  } Graduation Project }{Alexandria University}{Oct 2018-Present}{Alexandria,EG}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing a video translation Deep Learning model that captures location of body parts
\item Using location of chosen key-points on each body part to move an animated character with same motion made in video
\item Making a Unity graphical model that takes array of coordinates of each key-point and moves skeleton of it accordingly
\item Developing a user friendly mobile application that takes user video as input and outputs the motion translation on a chosen animated figure
\item \textit{\textbf{Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, Caffe (C++), Unity, Android (Kotlin)}}

\cvevent{Stanford's X-Ray Bone Abnormality Recognition Challenge}{Final project of Computer Vision course}{October 2018}{Alexandria, EG}
\begin{itemize}
\item Succeeded to implement a well documented Abnormality detection model on MURA dataset for 7 different bone types with good results
\item Performed data augmentation and weighted loss function to deal with imbalanced data and produce more training samples
\item Engineered different types of features extracted from data to get better results
\item Designed an Ensemble model of several weaker models and used minimal resources through efficient data generators
